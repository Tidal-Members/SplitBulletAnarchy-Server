# Split Bullet: Anarchy - Server Gamemode
This is what servers should load, alongside workshop content.

This should be cloned into a folder named "splitbullet" in a ``gamemodes/`` folder, usually ``addons/splitbullet/gamemodes/`` works best but is not required for use on a server.

The workshop client gamemode is automatically overwritten, so it can be safely mounted server-side.
